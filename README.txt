See below tech assignment we talked about. Please confirm that you will start.
* Design and implement a user fraud check module
* See below a sample of User class as a starting point (feel free to change the class as you see fit)
* Use kotlin or groovy
* Use gradle for building/testing module
* Any potential external services should be marked and mocked
* No persistence is necessary
* We are not providing detailed specs on purpose so that we can see your judgement calls
* We are not looking for a perfect solution, but it should look mature enough so that it could be evaluated
* Timeline is no more than 1 week, but it's up to you how much time you spend (10 min, 2 hours or ... each day)
* If it takes too long (more than 8 hours), just stop and we can continue/explain the thinking during our 2nd discussion round.
* Feel free to ask questions if anything is not clear.


// Sample
class User {
String id
String phone
String email
}

Thank you and good luck.
